## Abstract
This paper develops a multi-scale, data-driven approach to hedging climate risk in financial portfolios by estimating climate betas across both mixed frequencies (daily, weekly, monthly) and horizons (short-, mid-, and long-run). In the first step, asset-level exposures to climate risk—so-called climate betas—are estimated through a series of univariate
time-series regressions using various combinations of frequencies and rolling windows. In the second step, hedge portfolios are constructed by regressing innovations in climate risk indices onto the returns of portfolios sorted by these frequency- and horizon-specific betas. This two-step framework improves upon standard factor-mimicking portfolio (FMP)
methods by addressing their core limitations: weak factor identification, short sample length, and reliance on low-frequency data. The proposed method is entirely data-driven, avoiding narrative assumptions and enabling flexible implementation across asset universes. Preliminary out-of-sample results using the MCCC index and individual stocks
show that the multi-scale approach consistently outperforms traditional FMP models and, in some cases, matches or exceeds the performance of more complex, quantity-based hedging strategies.
